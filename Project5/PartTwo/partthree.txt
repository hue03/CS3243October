3. Of the three paging algorithms in Part Two – FIFO, LRU, and Second Chance –
   which one results in the lowest number of page faults in your simulation?
   What are the average page fault rates for each of the three?
   
   Given a random seed (1385127952), the number of page faults for each
   page-replacement algorithm are as follows:
   
   Page-Replacement Algorithm | # of Page Faults
   ---------------------------+------------------
   FIFO                       | 213468
   LRU                        | 222380
   Second Chance              | 217578
   
   For this particular instance, FIFO runs with the lowest number of page
   faults, followed by Second Chance, and then LRU.
   
   This, of course, only pertains to a particular case.  The average number of
   page faults are as follows:
   
   Page-Replacement Algorithm | Avg # of Page Faults
   ---------------------------+----------------------
   FIFO                       | 
   LRU                        | 
   Second Chance              |
